The phase after illness caused by an infectious disease is called
\textit{convalescence}. This section addresses the recovery and response of the
computing community in the wake of the worm.

\subsection*{Awareness and Perception}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Awareness and Perception}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item of the research community
        	\begin{itemize}
			\item virus vs. worm terminology (taxonomy)
			\item need for better passwords
			\item hashing algorithm
            \item this was too easy and it could have been much worse
           	\end{itemize}
		\item of the general public
           	\begin{itemize}
   			\item Internet becomes widely know technology
            \item cybercrime becomes more well known (at the same time... what a coincidence)
            \item Genius computer whiz?
            	\begin{itemize}
            		\item researchers: NO	
            		\item public: Yes	
            	\end{itemize}
        \item Is Morris a criminal?
            	\begin{itemize}
                \item yes, fire and brimstone (some researchers)
                \item yes, but don't punish too harshly (Cornell Commission and others)
                \item no, just a mistaken experiment
                \item no, he's a hero for demonstrating security flaws (transition to next section: blaming the victim)
                \item the real question - should accidents/experiments be considered crimes?
            	\end{itemize}
       \item Who is at fault: administrators vs. vendors\ldots beginning of
       ``blame the victim'' mentality
       \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Immune System Growth}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Immune System Growth}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item computer security as a legitimate field
        	\begin{itemize}
        	\item tons of publications
            \item questions about security design principles (like least privilege)
            \item questions about ethics and law ***(transition to next section)
        	\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\item prosecution under CFAA
    	\begin{itemize}
    	\item Morris' claim that it was unintentional... "knowingly" vs "intentionally"	.. accident
    	\item Morris' claim that he didn't gain ungranted access because he had access to Cornell computers
    	\item Precedent: the internet falls under CFAA
        \item Question: what if worm hadn't infected government computer?
    	\end{itemize}
    \item crisis response protocol
    	\begin{itemize}
    	\item formation of CERT at CMU
    	\item phage mailing list
    	\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
