The Morris Worm and subsequent decompiled and analyzed code provided
ancestral concrete examples of several attack vectors, like\ldots :
   		\begin{itemize}
   		\item email as a spread mechanism
   		\item scanning as a spread mechanism
        \item attacking weak passwords
        \item concept of use to spread other attacks  
   		\end{itemize} 

\subsection*{Descendants}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Descendants}
		\begin{itemize}
        \item Code Red
        \item Slammer
        \item Probably others... Nimbda, Stuxnet? etc... (I found mention but no substantive, concrete comparison)
		\end{itemize}
		
\subsection*{Evolved Awareness and Perception}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Evolved Awareness and Perception}
\begin{itemize}
	\item long term influence on perception 
    	\begin{itemize}
        \item new vulnerabilities and attacks on same old vectors for same old reasons ***(transition)
    	\item with new worms, people still saying the same thing in the aftermath
    	\item there isn't much question now: cybercriminals are criminals, not admirable geniuses or heros
    	\item there isn't much question now: we blame the victim... both of them. 
              Admins and vendors point fingers at eachother, following the Morris Worm trend
    	\end{itemize}
	\item Long term influence in formal cyber security and cyber crime
    	\begin{itemize}
        \item CFAA still being expanded to deal with criminals like Morris
        \item CERT still handling real crises, like the newer ones mentioned above
        \item CIRT is a commonly studied and applied topic
        \item Cyber Security is a more popular and relevant field than ever
    	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
