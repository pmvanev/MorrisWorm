	\item what this paper covered
	\item synthesize/speculate
   		\begin{itemize}
   		\item what else could have happened?
        \item if not for this worm, would something else have taken its place? probably, and it could have been meaner
        \item was the overall impact positive, negative, or neutral?... neutral to positive
        \item are Morris and other's like him brilliant? Not even in his day, and definitely not today... kiddies
        \item How have worm driven attacks evolved? (not by much honestly, they just spread faster)
        \item How has public perception of attacks shifted? - as far as blame, not much. as far as idolozing, very much
        \item How has prosecution of cybercrime changed over time? - still a cat and mouse came between technology and legislation
